Findings from Choe lab regarding the D614G mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were featured in a [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/science/coronavirus-mutation-genetics-spike.html) today. Many other outlets also reported the news, including [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/health/coronavirus-mutations-scripps-gene/index.html), [Der Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/medizin/corona-mutation-koennte-virusvariante-in-europa-ansteckender-machen-a-48aee808-600c-4428-a269-0304058a85d8), and BBC Newsday.

The data are available in my co-first author preprint with colleagues Lizhou and Huihui on [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.148726v1).
