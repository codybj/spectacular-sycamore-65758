          SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, binds and enters host
          cells by action of its spike protein. SARS-CoV-2, unlike other
          sarbecoviruses, has acquired a multibasic cleavage site at the
          junction of the S1 and S2 subunits which is processed by furin-like
          proprotein convertases in the virus-producer cell before encountering
          target cells. Therefore, intermolecular association of S1 and S2
          subunits are necessary to retain infectivity. Our work has clarified
          the nature of this interaction and revealed the mechanism of increased
          infectivity of the D614G variant by the effects of this amino acid
          change on S1-S2 interaction and spike protein density.

          Skeletal muscle is an ideal gene therapy target to act as a factory
          for the production and secretion of systemically-acting therapeutic
          proteins. However, current gene delivery technologies are limited in
          transduction efficiency in skeletal muscle. We developed a novel AAV
          vector targeting insulin receptor to achieve ~20-fold enhanced
          transduction of skeletal muscle *in vivo* with a modular approach that
          can be combined with other advances in AAV capsid engineering.
